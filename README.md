# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description the personal interest or problem that your animation addresses. Then explain the user story(s) you identified, and how they help frame making your animation.
The two user stories that this animation adresses include a chef wanting to create a fruit salad by picking fruits and mixing them in a bowl so others can follow their footsteps and a restaurant manager that is demonstrating how to cook/ put together a fruit salad so that the cehfs that they hire can do the same. In this animation, it demonstrates the process of creating a fruit salad that consists of blueberries, strawberries, and pineapples. Along with the fruit salad there are backgrounds, utensils, and other additonal items being used in the animation such as a fruit smoothie, table, spoon, knife, fork, bowl, table cloth, and e.t.c.. In order to create this animation, methods were necessary in order to create a Restaurant class. The fruitsalad order iterates through the list until it reachesa name that is equal to fruit salad. Many files and images were used to create this animation.
